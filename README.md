# Custom Sweet16 Firmware

Initially generated by [kbfirmware.com](kbfirmware.com), operated by [Ruiqi Mao](http://www.ruiqimao.com/)

Based on [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) by [Jack Humbert](https://github.com/jackhumbert)

This firmware is specifically for my eAmuse keypad, which uses a [Sweet16](https://www.1upkeyboards.com/shop/keyboard-kits/macro-pads/sweet-16-macro-pad-black/) macro pad.
